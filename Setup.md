### Environment

Download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)  
Download [.NET Core 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

### Framework and why this approach

We have highlighted the separation of concerns by drawing service boundary on DrumMachine server that is powered by [gRPC server](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/csharp/). The server is responsible for processing the input, synthesize the output and streaming the output in tempo. We have experimented with a streaming endpoint to play programmed music. This approach makes sense because we wanted to stay connected to the client and be able to control the tempo based on the selected bpm on the client. The idea is to set ourselves up to build iteratively and keep the client feature improvements separate from the server.
Our client is a console app which is powered by the same service contract.

### Project structure

```
    DrumMachine
    |
    |__src
    |   |__DrumMachine (server)
    |   |__DrumMachineClient (client)
    |
    |__test
        |__DrumMachineTest
```

### To start debugging with Visual Studio

1. Run the grpc server. Open Visual Studio and Debug `src\DrumMachine`.
2. Run the client. Open another Visual Studio and debug `src\DrumMachineClient`.
3. In `DrumMachineClient`, you can either use pre-defined request `BuildFirstRequest()` or `BuildSecondRequest()`, or build your own.
4. The output is printed in tempo on the client console. (Have a very low bpm to increase the gap between the beats)
